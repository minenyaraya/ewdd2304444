                <h4> Alignment: Everything on a page needs to be visually
                     connected to something else, nothing should be out of 
                     place or different from all other design elements. 
                     The alignment makes everything look organized, and in 
                     harmony, this article visualizes the alignment as a 
                     behavioral proposal staff. Below is a summarized list 
                     of the articles Roberto Bernal

                <ul>
                    <li>Alignment is important for the design of a page,
                        for the domino effect and to be successful</li>
                    <li>Alignment is a way of ordering
                        the main thing and expect good results</li>
                    <li>The domino effect comes from the alignment of actions</li>
                    <li>The domino alignment is an example of our own alignment</li>
                    <li>The domino effect brings a great implication, thanks to the alignment with a small action big things can collapse</li>
                    <li>Alignment is essential for success, as success is sequential.</li>
                    <li>Producing a domino effect seems as simple as aligning actions
                        and then put the first token in motion and that's it,
                        In real life every day you must align your
                        priorities, take action again to make
                        the other pieces fall. On Web pages, 
                        alignment has a great visual impact.</li>
                    <li>The small actions alignment approach works.
                        Simply because extraordinary success is sequential, not simultaneous.
                        Furthermore, what begins linearly ends up becoming exponential.</li>
                    <li>You must also persevere in achieving good alignment. We must keep in mind:"If you learn from mistakes, so do achievements".</li>
                    <li>There are two things you can pursue in life; The first is to take the action steps that you 
                        established aligned with the objectives you have set for 
                        yourself. The second is to enjoy while you take these steps
                         and celebrate them.</li>

                <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>

                <h4>In graphic design, contrast is generated when there is a notable difference between two elementsDifference in 
                    lighting intensity in the black and white range or in the color range of an image.</h4>
                <img class="amarillo" src="images/contraste.jpg" alt="Amarillo" width="180">
                <p>Contrast:
                    It has to do with sensory stimuli that allow elements 
                    or areas in a composition to be highlighted through 
                    the opposition or difference between them, that is, 
                    in a graphic design contrast is generated when there 
                    is a notable difference between two elements.
                    Contrast is one of the most fun principles in graphic 
                    design and even the most radical. It is about taking 
                    risks and making the main element of the graphic product 
                    around which all the others revolve, stand out from the rest.</p>
                     <h4>Ideas on how to generate contrast in a composition:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a large font with a much smaller one.</li>
                        <li>Use thick line strokes with other much thinner strokes.</li>
                        <li>Use the wide spectrum of colors and mix, for example, 
                            a cold color with a warm one. You can also play with 
                            saturations or intensities.</li>
                        <li>Play with the space between lines. Paragraphs with longer 
                            line spacing and blocks of text with shorter line spacing 
                            will create an immediate contrast.</li>
                        <li>The use of completely different textures will also achieve this effect.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
                <a href="https://www.itdo.com/blog/principios-universales-de-diseno-repeticion/">Sergio Vergara Website</a>
                
                <h4>Repetition makes us connected, 
                    when designing a page, repetition 
                    is a very important tool since we 
                    want the user to feel comfortable 
                    and be able to use simple, repeated 
                    tools and become familiar with the design, 
                    which makes it easier for the user to navigate
                     our website.</h4>
                     <img class="colimage" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6khnzLbvRt1q4vbe2wJm3XOUiwewskYPXmpqlArz6E1RJVMotNe508Th3yfBZl6ECMB1xLuAHbEyAbAgV3I8blwPigr0yKXMwhjUM9aub3l5HZ6tb6utkvSBOcVYYqKkOySHZPzk"  alt="placeholder image" width="180">
                <p>Repetition is the reuse of the same or similar elements throughout the design. Now this should not be confused with repeating visual elements like a pattern. Visual elements as a pattern have more to do with visual style.

                    Good design practice seeks to repeat some aspects of some element throughout a design. You should use repetition to create a sense of unity and consistency throughout your design. Repetition creates a particular style, cohesion, emphasis, and hierarchical structure, and strengthens your design.
                    
                    The goal of any design is to make some impression, preferably a lasting one. If your design achieves this objective, you will be fulfilling the communication purpose, with a particular message that persists and can become familiar.
